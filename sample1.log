With the new OOP plugin loader I've built for issue 95114, if a buggy plugin dies while probing it for MIME information, the browser no longer gets killed. But if the loader utility process dies, the user is left with no plugins. Instead, there should be a delicate little dance between the browser and utility processes such that one bad plugin doesn't prevent the user from having any plugins. This is more of an issue on Linux than on Mac because, in practice, the loader only dies on Mac with one specific QuickTime plugin. Linux seems to be more fragile.
