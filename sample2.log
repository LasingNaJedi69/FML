Attach a screenshot ifpossible.* Using Windows Vista Enterprise.* I am connecting to the internet through a proxy server (I'm at work);could possibly be that?  Not sure what else to configure since Chrome seemsto use Vista's standard Internet Options (and those are configuredcorrectly, at least as far as IE and FireFox are concerned).  I have noticed that I get a password prompt from my Proxy server whenever Istart Chrome.  Will try downloading Chrome at home tonight to see if the problem persists.
